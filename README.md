# CleBeN

This contains a Lexer made using JFlex (Educational Purpose)

## What's a Compiler?

A compiler is a computer program that translates code from a source language (usually a high-level programming language) into a target language (usually a low-level language), in order to create an executable program.

A typical compiler achieves this by following a series of steps:

1. **Lexical Analysis**: it takes a stream of characters (the source code) and outputs a stream of tokens.

2. Syntax Analysis;
3. Semantic Analysis;
4. Intermediate Code Generation;
5. Optimizing
6. Code Generation

> [!NOTE] PS:
> This project only focus in building a Lexer for OUR Programming Language, CleBeN.
